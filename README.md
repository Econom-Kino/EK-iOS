People always strive to find the fastest and the cheapest ways to solve their problems. The goal of our project is to help people with one of the issues. Our service will show you all of the latest movies that are on at the cinemas. After a user chooses the date and a specific movie, our app will provide him/her the information about the cinemas it is on, rating them by the price of the tickets from the cheapest to the most expensive. Thus, we optimized surfing the Internet for the information from a number of different sites to just clicking two buttons. This will help the users to find the information in no time,saving their time and efforts.
